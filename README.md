My-First-Website

I firstly created a HTML file for the design of my first website using the Cloud9 ide.
Code used through out the website consisted of both HTML and CSS forms which demonstrate the coding I have learnt so far from Codeinstitute.
The coding so far are structure from the modules explained through video clips, shown on the Codeinstitute on-line training.
There are 9 modules in total to learn from that demonstrate examples of coding and ways of practicing hands on methods through design until completion. Introduction to GitHub and Cloud9 ide is Two out of the other languages I will be learning from the on-line training course to become a Fullstack Web Developer.
