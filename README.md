My-First-Website

I firstly created a HTML file for the design of my first website using the Cloud9 ide.
Code used through out the website consisted of both HTML and CSS tags to demonstrate the coding I have learnt so far from Codeinstitute.
Both codes are structure using modules explained from video clip shown on the Codeinstitute on-line training.
There are 9 modules in total to learn from that demonstrate examples of coding and ways of practicing hands on methods through design and implementation of a Website.
